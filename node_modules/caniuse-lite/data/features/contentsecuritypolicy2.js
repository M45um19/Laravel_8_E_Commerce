# assert

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/browserify/commonjs-assert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/browserify/commonjs-assert)

This module is used for writing unit tests for your applications, you can access it with `require('assert')`.

It aims to be fully compatibe with the [node.js assert module](http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html), same API and same behavior, just adding support for web browsers.
The API and code may contain traces of the [CommonJS Unit Testing 1.0 spec](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Unit_Testing/1.0) which they were based on, but both have evolved significantly since then.

A `strict` and a `legacy` mode exist, while it is recommended to only use `strict mode`.

## Strict mode

When using the `strict mode`, any `assert` function will use the equality used in the strict function mode. So `assert.deepEqual()` will, for example, work the same as `assert.deepStrictEqual()`.

It can be accessed using:

```js
const assert = require('assert').strict;
```

## Legacy mode

> Deprecated: Use strict mode instead.

When accessing `assert` directly instead of using the `strict` property, the
